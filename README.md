Coding Exercise

For this exercise you will create a simple web application (refer Sample_UI.png for sample screens) that does the following:

Build the UI components in React to capture customer details in multi-step process.

  1. In Screen 1, capture First Name*, Middle Initial, Last Name*, Email Address*, Date Of Birth, Home Street Address*, 
    Apt Ste, Zip Code*, City*, State*#. Have "Continue" button to navigate to next screen.
  2. In Screen 2, show the data captured (it is like preview screen). Have "Submit" button to store the data captured 
    in a DB.
    
   *Add necessary client side validations for the form fields.
   #Use dropdown box for State field.

Build the server application stateless.

Build an REST API to perform above CRUD operations.

Use React, Redux, Node and any other api's/utilities to complete the assignment. You can use whatever db and back end technology you want as long as it can be executed in a Unix environment.

Detailed instructions for building, running and interacting with the application should be provided in the project.

You are free to use any command line tools such as Create React App to scaffold the app.

The exercise should generally not take more than 3-4 hours, although you're free to take as much time as you'd like to work on it. If you don't finish within a few hours, that's okay; submit what you've got anyway.

To submit the exercise,

  1. Deploy the application to some public location where we can interact with it (e.g. AWS S3, Heroku)
  2. Push the code to GitHub or some other code hosting service (private repository please - we can give you 
    usernames to add as collaborators), or send us an archive of your local git repository. We cannot accept email attachments or Dropbox links.

Please send code that you are proud to show us!
